2. Navigate to "Custom Message Settings" in the left-hand menu.
3. On the settings page, select the products for which you want to enable custom messages.

## Custom Message for Product Variations

This feature allows customers to add unique messages to their chosen product variations. For instance, customers can add personalized messages to cakes based on their preferences.

### How to Use:

2. Choose a specific variation, and if applicable, a "Custom Message" field will appear.
3. Enter your custom message in the provided text field.
4. Add the customized product to your cart.

## Display Custom Messages in Cart and Checkout

Custom messages added by customers are prominently displayed in the cart and during the checkout process. This ensures that customers can review their personalized messages before finalizing their purchase.

### How to Use:

1. After adding products with custom messages to your cart, proceed to the cart or checkout page.
2. On both the cart and checkout pages, custom messages for each product will be visible.

## SKU Display on Shop, Archive, and Single Product Pages

To enhance transparency and ease of identification, the plugin adds SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) information to product titles displayed on shop and archive pages. Additionally, SKU information is presented on individual product pages.

### How to Use:

1. Explore the shop or archive pages of the La Cakery website.
2. Product titles will include SKU information in parentheses (if available).
3. Visit a single product page, and the product title will display SKU information next to the name.

## Limit Product Quantity in Cart

With the **Limit Product Quantity in Cart** feature, you can set a maximum quantity limit for specific products in the cart. This prevents customers from ordering more than the allowed quantity for a particular product.

### How to Use:

1. When customers attempt to add a product with quantity exceeding the limit, an error message is displayed.
2. The maximum quantity can be customized to suit your business needs.

## Custom Variation Price Format

The **Custom Variation Price Format** feature modifies the displayed price for variable products. Instead of showing the full price range, the plugin showcases the minimum price with a "From" label, providing clarity to customers.
